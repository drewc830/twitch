Fetch Followers
There are some issues with the syntax.  I found this code on someone elses github but the API was deprecated so I have been working backwards and fixing things as I go.  If you run everything before the loop it will fetch a JSON file with the data.  I need to get the loop working where I can store the pagination and make another request with that code which will start at the next 100 users (can only fetch 100 users at a time).  I have the general idea of what I need to do but don't know Python syntax well enough to easily solve my problems and dont have any webdev experience.
